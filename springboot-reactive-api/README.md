# Spring Boot Reactive REST API

## Overview
This repository serves as a proof of concept (POC) highlighting the implementation of a Spring Boot Reactive REST API. The project utilizes an embedded H2 database to illustrate the capabilities of reactive programming within the Spring ecosystem.

## Objectives

This project showcases the prowess of reactive programming within the Spring framework, emphasizing the usage of reactive data access and processing through Spring Data R2DBC and Project Reactor. The embedded H2 database serves as a lightweight yet illustrative choice for this proof of concept.


## Technologies Utilized
* Spring Boot: Empowering rapid and efficient development of the REST API.
* Spring Data R2DBC: Utilizing reactive database drivers for seamless integration of reactive data access.
* Spring Webflux with Project Reactor: Leveraging reactive programming paradigms for asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
* Lombok: Simplifying Java code with concise annotations to reduce boilerplate code.
* Maven: Managing dependencies and project build.
